abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) auditing is a relatively new area of work. Currently, there is a lack of uniform standards and regulation. As a result, the AI auditing ecosystem is very diverse, and AI auditing professionals use a variety of different auditing methods. So far, little is known about how AI auditors approach the concept of trust in AI through AI audits, in particular regarding the trust of users. This paper reports findings from interviews with 19 AI auditing stakeholders to understand how AI auditing professionals seek to create calibrated trust in AI tools and AI audits. Themes identified included the AI auditing ecosystem, participants' experiences with AI auditing, and trust in AI audits and AI. The paper adds to the existing research on trust in AI and trustworthiness in AI by adding perspectives of key stakeholders regarding trust in AI Audits by users as an essential and currently less explored part of the trust in AI research. This paper shows how information asymmetry in respect to AI audits can decrease the value of audits for users and consequently their trust in AI systems. Study participants suggest key elements for rebuilding trust and suggest recommendations for the AI auditing industry, such as monitoring of auditors and effective communication about AI audits.},

abstract = {Online social media has revolutionized human interaction by fostering unparalleled cooperation and connectivity, surpassing the bounds of conventional, location-based methods. Despite their inherent limitations—such as physical boundaries, ongoing maintenance expenses, and rigidity—traditional methods impart a vital local context often neglected by digital platforms, potentially overshadowing local environmental engagement in favor of broader online networks. To mitigate this imbalance, it is essential to revitalize the significance of location-specific interactions. Augmented Reality (AR) stands out as a powerful means to enhance the accessibility and allure of such engagements. In this context, our research involved a detailed review and synthesis of existing location-based interactive services, pinpointing prevalent obstacles as well as offering strategic recommendations. Building upon these findings, we innovated ARMessageBoard, a prototype fusing AR with users’ immediate surroundings to craft virtual message boards. Our within-subjects study comprised 15 participants with an average age of 21.2 years (SD=5.5), systematically comparing ARMessageBoard with standard location-based mechanisms. Furthermore, we deliberated how blending AR with online social media could positively influence the convergence of virtual and real-world interaction landscapes, potentially enriching the individual’s role in shaping socio-digital exchanges.},

Previous research suggests chatbots as dynamic solutions, but the effective design of conversational XAI agents for practical human needs remains under-explored. This paper focuses on Conversational XAI for AI-assisted scientific writing tasks. Drawing from human linguistic theories and formative studies, we identify four design rationales: “multifaceted”, “controllability”, “mix-initiative”, “context-aware drill-down”. We incorporate them into an interactive prototype, ConvXAI 1, which facilitates heterogeneous AI explanations for scientific writing through dialogue. In two studies with 21 users, ConvXAI outperforms a GUI-based baseline on improving human-perceived understanding and writing improvement. The paper further discusses the practical human usage patterns in interacting with ConvXAI for scientific co-writing2.},

abstract = {AI assistance in decision-making has become popular, yet people's inappropriate reliance on AI often leads to unsatisfactory human-AI collaboration performance. In this paper, through three pre-registered, randomized human subject experiments, we explore whether and how the provision of second opinions may affect decision-makers' behavior and performance in AI-assisted decision-making. We find that if both the AI model's decision recommendation and a second opinion are always presented together, decision-makers reduce their over-reliance on AI while increase their under-reliance on AI, regardless whether the second opinion is generated by a peer or another AI model. However, if decision-makers have the control to decide when to solicit a peer's second opinion, we find that their active solicitations of second opinions have the potential to mitigate over-reliance on AI without inducing increased under-reliance in some cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for promoting effective human-AI collaborations in decision-making.},

abstract = {As AI systems progress in their capabilities, Human-AI Collaboration is likely to become an increasingly prevalent paradigm in many domains, including business, education, entertainment, and social activities. Historically, only computer-mediated collaborations involving at least two people have been considered part of the field of study known as CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work). This panel will engage CSCW 2024 attendees with the controversial and timely question of whether the purview of CSCW should be expanded to include research on "collaborations" involving a single person and one or more AI models or agents.},

abstract = {People work with AI systems to improve their decision making, but often under- or over-rely on AI predictions and perform worse than they would have unassisted. To help people appropriately rely on AI aids, we propose showing them behavior descriptions, details of how AI systems perform on subgroups of instances. We tested the efficacy of behavior descriptions through user studies with 225 participants in three distinct domains: fake review detection, satellite image classification, and bird classification. We found that behavior descriptions can increase human-AI accuracy through two mechanisms: helping people identify AI failures and increasing people's reliance on the AI when it is more accurate. These findings highlight the importance of people's mental models in human-AI collaboration and show that informing people of high-level AI behaviors can significantly improve AI-assisted decision making.},

In recent years, there has been a rise in using AI to empower social interactions and the capabilities of these systems. While these implementations charge ahead of the establishment of ethical and legal frameworks, it is timely to reflect on the state of AI-powered social computing systems and to identify new research agendas for the community. This Special Interest Group aims to bring in researchers and practitioners from different fields to foster discussions on the key considerations and challenges in designing for AI-powered social computing systems and to promote opportunities for new research collaborations.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:},
